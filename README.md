A streamlined Smart Contract solution to allocate Knockout Tournament tickets to fans using Blockchain.

# What is FORFANS?

The idea behind FORFANS is simple.

Traditionally, one ticket would be sold to just one individual. Using FORFANS, we can sell the same
ticket to multiple individuals depending on the team they are supporting. Only the individual whose team
makes it to the game is allowed to redeem the ticket.

Since there would be two teams in the game, this process has to be divided into two parts before applying.
